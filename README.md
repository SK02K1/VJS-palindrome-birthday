# VJS-palindrome-birthday

Created an app in Vanilla-JS to check if entered birthdate is Palindrome. If it is not palindrome, then it will show nearest palindrome date and by how many days it got missed.

This app checks your birthdate in 6 formats -

1. DD-MM-YYYY
2. MM-DD-YYYY
3. YYYY-MM-DD
4. DD-MM-YY
5. MM-DD-YY
6. YY-MM-DD
